Introduction
===============

Background
------------

`JPHES <http://jphes.uonbi.ac.ke>`_ is a web-based open source solution customized for *PEPFAR Kenya* partner reporting a
nd data attribution built on `DHIS2 <https://dhis2.org>`_.The platform replaces `KePMS <http://snisnet.net/KePMS.php>`_
reporting system which was a standalone *Microsoft Access* based indicator monitoring database for use in the management,
monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs supported by PEPFAR.It was developed in 2006 to plug
the gap between the Government of Kenya reporting system and the PEPFAR reporting requirements. It was designed to operate at
the level of in-country implementing partners who manage program specific data and forward it to national level where it is
aggregated automatically by United States of America Government (USG) program managers.

Now, the JPHES platform supports non-HIV indicator reporting, attribution of the indicators by partners, analysis
and visualition of attributed.It has Apps for maintaining the JPHES hierarchy, programs, user management and data push/pull.

Data for JPHES indicators already captured in the `National DHIS2 <https://hiskenya.org/>`_ is pulled routinely using an *API*
based middleware between the two systems.

Why JPHES?
------------

JPHES portal comes with the following benefits:

    1.To avoid double data entry to JPHES and the `National DHIS2 <https://hiskenya.org/>`_ by fetching the entered National
    DHIS2 data via the API.

    2.To perform attribution on the unattributed national DHIS2 data basing on Partner data element ownership for program level
    data consumption in decision making.

    3.To enhance the National DHIS2 data by pulling efforts of all implementing partners in making sure that the data entered
    into the national DHIS2 is accurate.

    4.The platform streamlines health data where all partners can access up to date data from the same database instance unlike
    the previous scenario where each partner was running their own KePMS instances.

    5.The portal provides aggregated data for programs per sites, mechanisms ,agencies and donor levels.

    6.Providing more analytical features for partners to monitor their own performance and make decisions informed by the data.

    7.The plaform has data quality, approval and validation features to ensure data in the system is accurate.

    8. It has an elaborate object sharing and role-based access, thus ensures users access functionalites and data based on
    their hierarchy level.
